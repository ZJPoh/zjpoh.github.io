I found it useful to reorganize the content of new things that I learn.
So, this is where I reorganize and record them.
All posts here are meant to be brief and with minimal explanation.
I hope everything here is correct and I'm sure not everything here is the best practice.
Also, these post may include my own thoughts.

I am an audiophile.
I listen to a very wide variety of songs.

I also like endurance challenges (running and biking) and snowboarding!
I have two super cute dogs, Poka and Ponyo.
