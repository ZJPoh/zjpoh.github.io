I found it useful to reorganize the content of new things that I learn.
So, this is where I reorganize and record them.
All posts here are meant to be brief and with minimal explanation.
I hope everything here is correct and I'm sure not everything here is the best practice.
Also, these post may include my own thoughts.

I am an audiophile.
I have a JH16 with JH3A.
My favorite composers are Gustav Mahler, Dmitri Shostakovich, and Johannes Brahms.
My favorite orchestra is Berliner Philharmoniker and Royal Concertgebouw.
I also listen to a lot of K-pop.
My favorite K-pop artists in alphabetical order are Cheeze, Davichi, GFriend, IU, Jeon Jin Hee, Lovelyz, Mamamoo, and WJSN.

I also like endurance challenges (running and biking).
I have two super cute dogs, Poka and Ponyo.
