I'm ZJ Poh, a physics PhD, a data scientist, and an audiophile.
I have two super cute dogs, Poka and Ponyo.
I like endurance challenges (running and biking).

I found it useful to reorganize the content of new things that I learn.
So, this is where I reorganize and record them.
All posts here are meant to be brief and with minimal explanation.
I hope everything here is correct and I'm sure not everything here is the best practice.
Also, these post may include my own thoughts.

My PhD thesis is _Model building in the LHC era: vector-like leptons and SUSY GUTs_.
My advisor is [Stuart Raby](http://inspirehep.net/author/profile/S.A.Raby.1).
Here is my [inSPIRE profile page](http://inspirehep.net/author/profile/Z.Poh.1).

I obtained my BA in Mathematics and Physics from [Ohio Wesleyan University](https://www.owu.edu/).
