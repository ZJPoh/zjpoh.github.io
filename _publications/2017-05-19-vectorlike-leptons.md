In this paper, we consider the Standard Model (SM) with one family of vector-like (VL) leptons, which couple to all three families of the SM leptons.
We study the constraints on this model coming from the heavy charged lepton mass bound, electroweak precision data, the muon anomalous magnetic moment, lepton flavor violation, Higgs decay constraints and a recently measured lepton non-universality observable, $R_{K^{\*0}}$.
We find that the strongest constraints are coming from the muon $gâˆ’2$, $R_{\mu\mu}=\Gamma(h\to\mu\mu)/\Gamma(h\to\mu\mu)\_\text{SM}$, $R_{\gamma\gamma}$ and $\text{BR}(\mu\to e\gamma)$.
Although VL leptons couple to all three families of the SM leptons, the ratio of electron-VL to muon-VL coupling is constrained to be $\langle \lambda_e/\lambda_\mu\rangle\lesssim10^{-4}$.
We also find that our model cannot fit the observed value of $R_{K^{\*0}}$.
